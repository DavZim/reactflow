The [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) R package is a wonderful tool for reproducible data science workflows.
To visualize a targets pipeline, there is the default `tar_visnetwork()` function, which creates a network visualization of the pipeline.

As this information is by definition a graph, `reactflow` can be used to visualize and style the pipeline in a more interactive way.

Note we won't be covering the `targets` package in this vignette, the code to create the targets pipeline etc is included in `reactflow` in `data-raw/example_targets.R` on Github.


```{r setup}
library(reactflow)
```
