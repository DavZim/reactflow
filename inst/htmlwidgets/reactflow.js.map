Because the resize affects x, y and width, height and width, height of a opposing side with keepAspectRatio,\n * the resize amount is always kept in distX & distY amount (the distance in mouse movement)\n * Instead of clamping each value, we first calculate the biggest 'clamp' (for the lack of a better name) and then apply it to all values.\n * To complicate things nodeOrigin has to be taken into account as well. This is done by offsetting the nodes as if their origin is [0, 0],\n * then calculating the restrictions as usual\n * @param startValues - starting values of resize\n * @param controlDirection - dimensions affected by the resize\n * @param pointerPosition - the current pointer position corrected for snapping\n * @param boundaries - minimum and maximum dimensions of the node\n * @param keepAspectRatio - prevent changes of asprect ratio\n * @returns x, y, width and height of the node after resize\n */\nfunction getDimensionsAfterResize(startValues, controlDirection, pointerPosition, boundaries, keepAspectRatio, nodeOrigin, extent, childExtent) {\n    let { affectsX, affectsY } = controlDirection;\n    const { isHorizontal, isVertical } = controlDirection;\n    const isDiagonal = isHorizontal && isVertical;\n    const { xSnapped, ySnapped } = pointerPosition;\n    const { minWidth, maxWidth, minHeight, maxHeight } = boundaries;\n    const { x: startX, y: startY, width: startWidth, height: startHeight, aspectRatio } = startValues;\n    let distX = Math.floor(isHorizontal ?
